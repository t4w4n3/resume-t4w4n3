## Getting Started
-------
- [Forked from](https://github.com/ddbullfrog/resumecard/fork)
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/resumecard`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Configuration
-------
- _config.yml
-  CNAME
	If you're using it on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, 
	you'll want to change it to be the domain you're going to use. 
	All that should be in here is a domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
-  avatar.JPG
	This is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's address bar. 
	You should change it to whatever you'd like.
